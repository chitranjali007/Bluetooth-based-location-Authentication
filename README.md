Bluetooth-based-location-Authentication
=======================================

The number of people who use geosocial location-based services like Foursquare [1] has more than doubled in the last year. Location based apps have become an easy source of word-of-mouth publicity and promotion, because of its powerful share and discovery factor. Companies have found location based apps to be a powerful and extremely effective tools to replace traditional advertising methods. Some popular business which uses LBS are Gowalla [2], which awards its customers for visiting new places, Groupon [3] which provides information about the daily deals in the nearest retail shops, SCVNGR [4] which gives points to its users for visiting new places and carrying out certain challenges.
The point is that all these applications use GPS as a source of finding out the current location of users. They completely rely on GPS but GPS comes with some or many fallacies.
Bluetooth if used with some techniques and proper observations of users, can help to replace the GPS. My project has implemented a protocol known as LINK protocol [5] which can help to accomplish this task.

This project basically has two main parts one is webserver part where the protocol has been implemented using java servlet, 
and an android part which which is used as an example to demostrate the utillization of LINK protocol..
